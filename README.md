\# Credit Card Fraud Detection

\## Exploratory Data Analysis and Insights Report



\## 1. Introduction

Credit card fraud poses a significant challenge to financial institutions due to

its financial impact and the highly imbalanced nature of transaction data. This

project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on credit card

transaction data to uncover patterns and characteristics associated with

fraudulent activities.



The analysis emphasizes understanding data distribution, transaction behavior,

and differences between fraudulent and legitimate transactions.
